## Introduction

The test app has been developed with xCode 7.2 and Objective-C.


### General comments
- App is universal and it fits all possible devices, from iPhone4s to iPad Pro
- If no item is selected, the 'Checkout' button is disabled.
- Spending more time on it, the UI and UX could be improved, e.g. adding interactive coachmarks
- I created a singleton class for useful methods, like network service
